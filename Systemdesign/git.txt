How git works?
    git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple users to collaborate on and track the project.
    Each user creates a local copy of the repo and then sync it with remote repo.
    When users wants to make a change, creates a local branch, makes the changes, which does not effect the main branch.
    Once changes are done, they "commit" their changes to local repo. Each commit has unique SHA-1 hash value.
    Once user is ready, they "push" their changes to the remote repo. This updates the remote repo.
    Other users can "pull" the changes from remote repo.
    One of the key features is to track the history of changes made to the file.
    Git allows multiple users to work on different features at same time.

git algorithm?
    git uses distributed version control algorithm called "Content Addressable FileSystem"(CAFS)
