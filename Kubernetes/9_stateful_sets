Stateful sets are used for applications like dbs, message queues and other applications that require stable network identities.

During pod restarts, pod name can change. Stateful sets helps to overcome this by providing the unique name to each pod.
In stateful sets, ordering and uniqueness is guaranteed.
eg: pod name can be web-0, web-1 etc. If a pod web-1 does, it will always be created with web-1.

While deleting as well, first web-1 is deleted and then web-0 is deleted.

Just like deployments, stateful sets also provide ability to scale up/down replicas, update the pods and perform rolling updates.

For stateful sets we cannot use any service. We need to use headless service.
In headless service, your pod or app can directly use dns names for writing into pod.
